#D'Novo

##about.
***

D'novo is about sharing your life's journeys with others through photos, video and text. The earliest version was created in one week by a team of two as the final project for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive.

This project is very much still a work in progress, and not production-ready. But if you want to try out the super-duper alpha version to get a feel for the app, head on over to [de-novo.herokuapp.com](http://de-novo.herokuapp.com) and create an account.
